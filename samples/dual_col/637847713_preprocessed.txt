Date and Time: 5/2/2023 16:04:07

Department: Surgery
Recommends: He will review arterial ultrasound when completed.

5/2/2023 17:28:11 Dr. Johnson reports ultrasound is normal and patient can be

Clinical Course: Patient is a 53-year-old female who was sent to us from Dr. Fred Littles
and radiation oncology. He called and talked me and stated the patient had a swollen
right leg and a cold foot and they could not palpate pulses. She is being treated
for ovarian cancer and a large mass in her pelvis. Upon arrival went into evaluate the
patient and her staff brought Dopplers then. We are able to Doppler a good dorsalis
pedis pulse in the right foot. Foot was cold however the left foot was also cold. We
spoke with Dr. Mark Johnson is a vascular surgery we will obtain a arterial ultrasound
which she will review once it is done. Once ultrasound was done Dr. Mark Johnson, he
said that the patient had normal blood flow. We initially discussed the possibly doing a
CTA of the aorta with runoffs. However the patient is allergic to iodine and it causes
her throat to swell shut. I reviewed the results of the ultrasound with the patient and
she is very happy to hear that there is no abnormalities. She is ready for discharge. All
questions answered.
