Diagnostic Results
CT Pelvis ENH no oral

MAY/02/23 18:18:00
Impression:

1. Left gluteal cellulitis without a discrete
abscess seen. There is a questionable linear
tract extending from the perianal region at
the 4 o'clock position to the cellulitic left
gluteal fat which could reflect a sinus tract
however this is not well characterized with
CT and if needed, a fistula protocol MRI
would be recommended to more completely
characterize this finding.

2. Post hysterectomy with gas in the vagina,
likely an incidental finding however the
rectosigmoid is immediately adjacent to the
vagina and if there is any evidence of
feculent discharge from the vagina at this
could reflect a colovaginal fistula. Correlation
with clinical history is recommended.

Diagnostic Results
CT Pelvis ENH no oral

MAY/02/23 18:18:00
Impression:

1. Left gluteal cellulitis without a discrete
abscess seen. There is a questionable linear
tract extending from the perianal region at
the 4 o'clock position to the cellulitic left
gluteal fat which could reflect a sinus tract
however this is not well characterized with
CT and if needed, a fistula protocol MRI
would be recommended to more completely
characterize this finding.

2. Post hysterectomy with gas in the vagina,
likely an incidental finding however the
rectosigmoid is immediately adjacent to the
vagina and if there is any evidence of
feculent discharge from the vagina at this
could reflect a colovaginal fistula. Correlation
with clinical history is recommended.
