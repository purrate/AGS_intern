CLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain

TECHNIQUE: Standard CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis was performed with
IV contrast. This CT exam was performed using one or more of the
following dose reduction techniques: Automated exposure control,
adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size, or use of
iterative reconstruction technique.
COMPARISON: September 29, 2016

FINDINGS:

Lung base: Linear density at the right lung bases atelectasis.

Liver: The liver is normal in size and density. There are no masses.
There is no intra-or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

Spleen: Normal in size without focal lesion.

Pancreas: Normal without calcification, mass or peripancreatic fluid.

of the left pelvis is likely an abscess related to sigmoid
diverticula disease. There is inflammation seen in the mesentery in
the central and left pelvis. There is no evidence for bowel
obstruction. There is no free air. There is no significant ascites..
The appendix is normal in appearance

Bladder: Normal without wall thickening, calculi or diverticuli.

GU: No acute findings and no pelvic masses or adenopathy.

Osseous structures: Normal.

or dissection. There is no retroperitoneal or para-aortic
lymphadenopathy.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain

TECHNIQUE: Standard CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis was performed with
IV contrast. This CT exam was performed using one or more of the
following dose reduction techniques: Automated exposure control,
adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size, or use of
iterative reconstruction technique.

COMPARISON: September 29, 2016

FINDINGS:

Lung base: Linear density at the right lung bases atelectasis.

Liver: The liver is normal in size and density. There are no masses.
There is no intra-or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

thickening or pericholecystic fluid.

Adrenal glands: Normal without masses.

Kidneys: The kidneys are normal in size and position. There are no
stones identified. There is no evidence for obstruction. No masses
are identified

of the left pelvis is likely an abscess related to sigmoid
diverticula disease. There is inflammation seen in the mesentery in
the central and left pelvis. There is no evidence for bowel
obstruction. There is no free air. There is no significant ascites..
