History of Present Illness
90-year-old female with history of CKD, hypertension, presented
emergency department for evaluation of head and hip pain after
a mechanical fall out of bed. Patient has been struggling
with leg cramps for a while and recently started on magnesium
and potassium for them. Those affected her this morning
causing her to fall out of bed striking her right ear onto a corner
of a wall not dresser. She then fell onto her right hip. She has
pain in the posterior aspect of both hips worse on the right. She
is still able to walk. She denies any weakness or numbness,
LOC, vomiting. She did get somewhat dizzy after this but
reports no other falls and was able to get herself back into
bed and debated for most the day whether or not to come in.
Review of Systems
10 point ROS was obtained and is otherwise negative except as
mentioned above.
Physical Exam
General: alert, no acute distress
Skin: warm, dry
Head: Punctate laceration to the outer aspect of the pinna, dried
blood covering the pinna otherwise no evident trauma,
normocephalic
Neck: trachea midline, no meningismus, no midline cervical
spine tenderness
Eye: normal conjunctiva, sclera clear
Cardiovascular: HRRR normal peripheral perfusion
Respiratory: CTAB, non-labored respirations
Gastrointestinal: soft, ND, NT
Extremities: no deformity, tenderness at the right PSIS greater
than right trochanter greater than left PSIS, otherwise no
deformity, bony tenderness
Neurological: oriented x4, LOC appropriate, CN II-XII intact,
motor strength equal and normally bilaterally, speech normal
Psychiatric: cooperative, affect appropriate for age, normal
judgement, normal psychiatric thoughts
Medical Decision Making
90-year-old female presented to the emergency department for
evaluation of injuries after a fall including ear trauma, head
trauma and right hip trauma. Given the patient's advanced age
she is at high risk for intracranial injuries and cervical spine
fracture for which CT head and neck were ordered. Obtain
screening chest x-ray, screening labs and EKG as well as x-rays
of both hips for further evaluation of possible fracture.

Imaging showed no acute traumatic injuries. Labs showed
creatinine 1.7 which is near the patient's baseline. Labs
otherwise show no clinically significant abnormalities. EKG
showed no evidence of arrhythmia ischemia or block. Patient
stable for outpatient management. Advised patient follow-up
with her primary care provider. Return precautions discussed.
Patient discharged home.
