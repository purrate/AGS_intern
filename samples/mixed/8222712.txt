Medical Decision Making
Assessment: 52 yo M presenting with several weeks of nocturnal
dry cough, leg edema, dyspnea on exertion. In ED, mildly
tachypneic with stigmata of peripheral fluid overload but does not
appear to be in acute respiratory distress and is not requiring
supplemental O2 to maintain normal saturations. Recent outpt
bloodwork notable for elevated proBNP, likely CKD, and elevated
transaminases. Repeat blood work today with uptrending Cr not
quite c/w AKI, improving LFTs, proBNP lateral. CXR with
cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema. These findings are all
suggestive of heart failure, although patient does not carry this
diagnosis. No consolidation on x-ray or fever to suggest PNA. Pt is
scheduled to establish with a cardiologist in clinic on
10/30. Discussed this impression and findings with patient. Offered
admission for continued diuresis, but pt requesting discharge
home. He was provided with a dose of IV lasix while in the ED and
encouraged to follow up as scheduled. Return precautions
provided.
